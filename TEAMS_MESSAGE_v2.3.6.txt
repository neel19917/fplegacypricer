🚀 **FreightPOP Legacy Pricer - Version 2.3.6 "Opal" Released!**

Hi Sales Team! 👋

We've just released an important update to the Legacy Pricer with critical bug fixes and new features to help you identify when custom pricing is needed.

**🐛 Critical Bug Fix:**
✅ Fixed an issue where Parcel tiers weren't pulling correctly from the pricing file. All products now correctly use the latest pricing data.

**✨ New Feature - Automatic Tier Validation:**
The system now automatically detects when shipment volumes exceed tier limits and highlights them in **RED** with clear error messages. This helps you quickly identify when you need to contact sales for custom pricing.

**What You'll See:**
🔴 Product rows highlighted in red when volumes exceed tier limits
⚠️ Clear error message: "Volume exceeds tier limits - Custom Pricing Required"
💰 Cost columns show "Request Quote" instead of pricing
📝 Helpful tooltips explaining the issue

**Products Affected:**
• Core TMS - Freight
• Core TMS - Parcel
• Ocean Tracking
• Locations
• Support Package
• Auditing Module
• Fleet Route Optimization
• Dock Scheduling

**How It Works:**
The system automatically detects three scenarios:
1. Volume below minimum tier
2. Volume above maximum tier
3. Volume between tier gaps (no matching tier)

All scenarios trigger red highlighting and custom pricing alerts.

**What This Means for You:**
✅ No more guessing if a volume needs custom pricing
✅ Clear visual indicators make it obvious when to escalate
✅ Consistent error handling across all products
✅ Faster quote generation with fewer errors

**Questions or Issues?**
If you notice any problems or have questions, please reach out to the development team or open an issue on GitHub.

Thanks for your continued feedback! 🙏
